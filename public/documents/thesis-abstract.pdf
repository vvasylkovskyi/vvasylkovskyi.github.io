Abstract
Social   Robots   (SR)   can   record   large   streams
of  raw  data  in  the  form  of  images,   audio,   Radio
FrequencyIdentification(RFID),amongother
sensory   sources,    which   could   be   instrumental   in
enforcing  Human-robot  interactions  (HRI).  However,
the  emotional  bonds  between  humans  and  SR  can
raise   an   SR   accessing/inferring   profoundly   private
information, e.g., emotional states.  Therefore, in what
concerns  privacy,  SR  may  be  a  liability.    Clarifying
the  ownership  of  data  collected  by  robots  is  an  issue
of   concern   in   the   European   Union   (EU)   General
Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR),  which  requires
’privacy-by-design’.    The  paper  presents  BlockRobot
–   a   Blockchain   (BC)-based   software   design   model
fordevelopingprivacy-by-designapplicationin
Human-Robot Interactions (HRI). Based on this design
model,  users can access the private data generated in
their  HRI.  This  paper’s  contributions  are  the  design
and validation of a model to develop privacy-by-design
applications   for   HRI.   This   model   integrates   BC
technology with robots to audit robotic events such as
Red,  Green,  Blue,  Depth  (RGB-D)  images,  and  RFID
tags.   Smart  contracts  and  crypto-wallets  accomplish
identity management.  To demonstrate the utility of the
initial  implementation  of  a  Decentralized  Application
(dApp),   we   implement   a   prototype,   based   on   the
private  permissioned  Evolution  of  Scalability  (EOS)
Blockchain integrated with the social robot moving in a
non-laboratory environment.
1.    Introduction
Social robots are designed to assist humans socially.
The  way  a  person  interacts  with  a  social  robot  is
quite  different  from  interacting  with  an  autonomous
robot.  People prefer to interact with robots with basic
communication  and  social  skills.    Social  interactions
imply the implementation of a new vast broad of features
that  require  multidisciplinary  research  [1].   Scientists
need   to   understand   the   philosophical,   ethical,   and
legal layers that motivate typical human behavior.   To
create social robots capable of genuine social behavior,
they  need  to  interact  with  humans  at  an  emotional
level  [2]  and  act  socially  expected  by  humans.    The
long-term  goal  is  to  assist  humans  in  tasks,  such  as
education,  health,  entertainment,  communication,  and
tasks  requiring  teamwork.   On  the  one  hand,  SR  can
collect  data  from  (among  many  other  sensors)  RGB
and RGB-D images, record audio data, react to human
voices,   and  detect  RFID  signals.RGB-D  images
(cf.Fig.  1)  are  depth  images  in  which  the  value  of
each  pixel  in  the  image  represents  the  distance  to  the
object.    They  provide  the  ability  to  accurately  sense
and  track  humans  and  objects  without  the  possibility
of  complete  identification  [3].RFID  signals  give
information  regarding  the  position,  and  proximity  can
be  inferred  [4–6].   On  the  other  hand,  people  tend  to
bond with  SR that  look like  humans and  are likely  to
interact with them at an emotional level [7] (in general,
within the bounds of the uncanny valley paradigm [8]).
Due to the variety and unprecedented volume of private
data  that  SR  can  collect,  they  raise  questions  about
privacy [9] and security [2], subjecting them to GDPR
[10, 11]   –   a European Regulation that imposes legal
compliance to all the public and private companies.
In  Human-robot  interactions  (HRI),  it  is  not  easy
to  prove  the  provenance  and  continuous  compliance
with  GDPR  if  end  users  cannot  access  the  SR  data.
Moreover, due to the incomplete implementation of the
Figure 1:  RGB-D Images captured by robot:  Left  –  a
person is clearly visible; Right  –  no person in sight.

GDPR principles, concerns on the lack of transparency
may   be   raised.Besides   the   privacy   enforcing
techniques   employed   by   a   CA,   there   is   growing
attention to the decentralized private data management
paradigm.  Decentralized solutions such as Blockchain
provide   high-level   properties   ofdecentralization,
transparency,tamper-resistance,   andtraceability.
For  that  reason,  Blockchain  is  an  excellent  candidate
to comply with GDPR for HRI. In this paper, we show
how BC, when integrated with SR, can improve users’
privacy in HRI, resulting in a better experience.  Using
a case study, we demonstrate the utility of a BC-based
architecture encompassing an implementation of adApp
based   on   a   private   permissioned   EOS   Blockchain,
integrated  with  an  SR.  Our  solution  allows  end-users
(hospital staff, patients, and visitors) to control private
data  generated  during  their  interaction  with  the  SR
transparently and fairly. The experiments are performed
in hospital corridors and rooms. The execution data logs
are  computed  with  process  mining  techniques  [12]  to
analyze the performance and bottlenecks existing in the
case study.
The remaining of the paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 presents the relevant background.  Section 3
describes  in  detail  the  proposed  architecture  and  its
information workflows. Section 4 illustrates the working
example. Section 5 provides discussion and limitations,
and Section 6 concludes and points to future work.
2.    Background
This   section   provides   a   brief   introduction   to
Blockchain and exemplifies related work regarding its
benefits for privacy and robotics.
2.1.    Blockchain-based Technologies for
Privacy
Blockchain is a distributed shared ledger replicated
over the network nodes interacting between themselves
based   on   a   set   of   rules   known   as   a   consensus
system.The  primary  data  structure  of  a  BC  is  a
block encompassing a set of transactions.   Each block
is  chained  to  the  previous  block  by  cryptographic
hashes [13], making it virtually impossible to erase BC
data.   The  participants  can  write  to  the  BC  to  modify
its  state  by  creating  transactions,  but  cannot  erase  it.
There are three variations of BC based on the permission
model:permissionless–   any party can to read from
and  write  to  the  BC;permissioned–   access  to  the
BC  is  restricted  to  authorized  parties,  and;partially
permissioned–some  actions,  for  example,  read
access,  is  granted  to  anyone,  but  other  actions,  for
example,  write  access,  may  be  limited  to  authorized
parties.
BC   has   been   implemented   in   different   areas,
including  improving  privacy.    In  the  scope  of  access
control,   Zyskind   et   al.propose   a   decentralized
privacy   solution   using   a   Blockchain   to   enforce   a
self-sovereign access-control management [14]. Truong
et   al.propose   a   BC-based   solution   to   improve
the   integrity   and   transparency   of   data   stored   by
centralized  entities  [15].Faber  et  al.proposed  a
human-centric and GDPR-compliant personal data and
identity  management  system  based  on  the  Blockchain
technology [16].
2.2.    ROS, RFID and Blockchain in Robotics
Many  robots  operate  on  ROS  (Robot  Operating
System)  –  a middleware to develop robot applications.
The  ROS  contains  robotic  events  stored  temporarily
in  the  robot’s  named  structures   –   ROS  topics  [17].
The  use  of  ROS  when  developing  robots  is  a  natural
choice.    It  is  common  for  robots  operating  on  ROS
to be enabled with RFID sensors to detect RFID tags.
RFID technology enables detecting contactless ID tags
in scenarios where identification features with minimal
false   positives   are   required   [6].When   integrated
with  robots  and  ROS,  these  wireless  sensors  provide
information on RFID tags’ position [6].
In  the  literature  on  HRI,  some  efforts  demonstrate
how BC can enhance privacy in HRI. Ferrer et al. [18]
use  BC  technology  to  improve  privacy  when  sharing
sensitive  data  between  robots  and  machine  learning
models.Their  solution  is  prominent  in  increasing
transparency    in    HRI.    A    research    conducted    by
Degarding and Alexandre [19] shows how Blockchain
can  assist  in  auditing  robotics  events.   Fernandes  and
Alexandre  also  proposed  Blockchain’s  use  to  audit
robotics   events   by   using   Tezos’s   technology   [20].
Their research intends to explore the BC immutability
properties   to   solve   the   problem   of   tampering   the
records  of  robotic  actions  in  the  context  of  factory
robots.   Integrating  BC  with  robots  seems  to  improve
cooperation   by   providing   the   robots   with   a   single
immutable  source  of  truth  where  they  can  share  the
knowledge base [21].
With  this  research  in  mind,   BC  seems  like  an
excellent   candidate   in   developing   privacy-by-design
applications   to   improve   privacy   in   HRI.Private
permissioned Blockchainis the most reasonable choice
to  enhance  the  privacy  of  individuals’  data  because  it
provides restricted access to the network.

3.    Architecture Design
This section describes the design architecture of the
BlockRobot  dApp(Fig.  2).    The  system  is  composed
of the basic interaction between a robot and a human,
starting in theHRI layer.  The robot is equipped with
RGB-D camera  –  used to record streams of images; and
an RFID sensor that can detect RFID tags from which
the  information  about  proximity  can  be  inferred  [6].
We  equip  individuals  with  RFID  tags  embedded  into
smart  cards,  so  that  robot  with  RFID  laser  can  detect
individuals without the line of sign or ambiguity (with
anonymization techniques).  After the basic interaction
of  a  human  by  the  robot,   both  streams  of  images
and  the  RFID  tags  are  published  as  separate  ROS
events.   Furthermore,  the  BlockRobot  API  can  access
that  data  inAPI  layerthrough  the  ROS  Middleware
–    software  that  allows  us  to  read  robotic  events  in
thepublish-subscribe  pattern.    The  BlockRobot  API
is a trusted server that handles data transformations of
ROS events into private data, and operates the off-chain
storage by synchronizing the on-chain transactions with
off-chain database updates.  Once the BlockRobot API
main algorithms retrieve private data from ROS events,
the data can be persisted inBlockchain and Persistence
layer, which represents the storage of data   –   through
BC  and  off-chain  repository,  and  the  access  of  data
–   managed  by  the  smart  contracts.   To  modify  BC’s
state,  individuals  and  robots  interact  with  BC  are  the
peers  –  by issuing the transactions.
3.1.    Design Guidelines
In   this   section,    we   provide   the   main   design
guidelines to develop privacy-by-design applications for
HRI.
Figure2:High-levelSystemArchitectureof
BlockRobot
Correct   data   outline:(i)The   communication
should  be  achieved  by  subscribing  to  the  ROS  topics
through  ROS  middleware,  both  to  prevent  additional
overhead on the robot and obtain all the relevant data
for  private  data  classification  algorithms,  e.g.,  RFID
tags and RGB-D images.(ii)The individuals’ identities
should be anonymized to ensure data confidentiality and
security.
Data Persistence(i)BC should be used as a trust
anchor.  In other words, the data to be stored on-chain
are the hashes of private data. BC is immutable storage,
therefore placing hashes on BC will provide verifiability
of data integrity.(ii)The private data should be persisted
off-chain,  e.g.,  traditional  DBMS  (e.g.,  PostgreSQL,
MongoDB),  a  cloud  storage  (e.g.,  AWS  or  Azure),  a
distributed  storage  system  (e.g.,  IPFS,  [22]).   Storage
of the private data off-chain allows it to be deleted, as
required by GDPR’ ”Right to be Forgotten” [10, p. 32].
Furthermore, to provide confidentiality of private data,
(iii)the  off-chain  data  should  be  encrypted,  naturally,
with the data owner’s keys. As an example, the possible
algorithms to consider are Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem
or  RSA  [23].(iv)For  faster  lookup,  the  off-chain
and  on-chain  data  should  be  linked,  for  instance,  as
in  the  example  further  demonstrated  in  section  4  by
Transaction ID (TXID).(v)The off-chain and on-chain
should be synchronized.  Once a new block is validated
in  the  BC,  the  off-chain  database  should  be  triggered
to align the change.  Accordingly,  if a participant or a
robot update the BC state, then the off-chain state will
update as well.(vi)Robots and participants should act
as  peers in  Blockchain to  provide the  provenance  and
non-repudiation of private data.
User  Interface  and  BC  Transactions(i)Private
data generated in HRI should be easily retrievable and
presented in a human-readable format through the user
interface.(ii)Once presented with the data, users should
be able to access and erase their private data by UI.(iii)
Users  should  create  a  new  transaction  to  the  BC  per
each access or deletion of data. By being an immutable
truth source, all the actions can be audited on the BC,
thus providing accountability.(iv)To prove the user’s
identity securely, each individual should have a crypto
wallet keeping the private and public keys.  The crypto
wallet should be integrated with the user interface and
request  a  digital  signature  on  each  transaction.    The
digital signature is proof of the individual’s identity that
needs to be provided on each data’s access and erasure.
3.2.    Data Subject Classification
During   the   interactions   between   a   robot   and   a
human, the robot may record large streams of images.

To   illustrate,   we   present   the   interaction   design   in
Figure 3, where the robot records RGB-D images while
a  person  walks  by  the  robot.    A  person  is  equipped
with  a  smart  card  with  an  embedded  RFID  tag.    As
the  interaction  goes,  and  streams  of  RGB-D  images
are  published  on  the  RGB-D  Topic,  the  RFID  laser
embedded  in  the  robot  detects  an  RFID  tag  from  the
person’s smart card. It is worth to note that the RFID tag
detection  and  RGB-D  image  are  asynchronous  events
because  the  RFID  laser  and  the  kinetic  camera  are
separate devices.  Therefore, the data from both events
require additional coordination.
RFID   tags   provide   information   regarding   the
proxemics and time relating to the RFID laser. Previous
research  [6]  points  out  that  RFID  tags  are  subject  to
background  noises,  depending  on  the  environmental
conditions, which may reduce the precision of the time
and  distance  of  an  individual  carrying  tags.Still,
they  provide  knowledge  that  some  individuals  are  in
the robot’s vicinity, which is valuable for identification
purposes.The   RFID   signal   is   composed   of   the
UID–   unique identifier,  and the timestamp when the
RFID signal was detected.  Furthermore, the UID gets
anonymized by hashing it, with the intuit to difficult the
individual’s possible re-identification.
In  real-world  scenarios,   many  people  may  walk
by  the  robot.Therefore,   many  RFID  signals  will
be  identified  simult
ˆ
aneously.For  that  reason,   all
the  anonymized  UIDs  and  timestamp  retrieved  from
each  RFID  tag  are  temporarily  stored  in  the  off-chain
repository.The  storage  of  the  UIDs  will  allow  us
to  consult  the  information  about  all  the  individuals
detected in HRI, and consequently, who is present in the
RGB-D image recorded at a specific time.
On the other hand,  to identify an individual in the
network, we persist his/her anonymized UID on the BC
(Further explained).  Besides being immutable, placing

–  Classification of data owner model
Figure 4:  Time Pairing model:  Left –   Image detected
out  of  bounds  of  RFID  detection;   Right  –Image
detected in bounds of RFID detection
RFID tags on BC provides an indirect relation between
known  participants  and  their  RFID  tags.   Finally,  the
algorithm  has  enough  data  to  know(i)who  are  the
known  members  of  the  network–UIDs  stored
on-chain,   and(ii)who  are  the  individuals  detected
in  a  specific  time  interval    –    UIDs  and  timestamps
temporarily  stored  off-chain.   Then  two  lists  of  UIDs
are  reduced  into  a  list  of  known  members  detected  in
a given interval.  For each RGB-D image, this list will
be used to understand whether an individual in a list is
present in the RGB-D image. If yes, then we can create
a  unique  data  structure  containing  the  RGB-D  image
and individuals identified in the image.  The details are
discussed in theTime-Pairing Algorithm.
3.3.    Time-Pairing Algorithm
The  Time-pairing  algorithm  consists  of  examining
each  RGB-D  image  and  the  list  of  RFID  tags,  and
give as output whether that RGB-D image is a private
data  or  not.   If  it  is  a  private  data,  meaning  there  are
individuals identified in the image, it also says who the
individuals are. Each RFID detected is a single event in
the time-pairing algorithm.  Therefore if there are many
participants near the robot,  many RFID events will be
published. One RGB-D image is also an event. Different
inputs,  such  as  a  list  of  RFIDs,  one  RFID,  or  zero
RFIDs collected from events during the HRI, will trigger
different outcome scenarios.  Furthermore, for different
RFIDs detected, based on the timestamps of detection,
we estimate how long the participant identified shall be
considered to remain close to the robot.∆denominates
this estimate.
We  define∆as  a  certain  interval  for  which  the
person carrying a tag should be considered in the robot
vicinity.  For simplicity, here and after, we will refer to
the  RFID  tag  detection  as  the  same  as  the  individual

Figure  5:  Identity  Management  Model  –  Registration
and Authentication
being  detected.    For  each  individual  detected  by  the
robot,  we  take  this  event’s  timestamp  and  enclose  it
with∆, which will give us the interval of time when the
person remains near the robot.Twopossible outcomes
may  happen  (illustrated  in  Figure  4):(i)The  out  of
bound time-pairing(Fig. 4 - Left) –  In this outcome,
the estimated interval of the person’s presence near the
robot does not intersect with the time when the image
is  recorded.In  this  case,  the  algorithm  detects  no
participant in the RGB-D image, and therefore this is not
a private data.(ii)The inbound time-pairing(Fig. 4 -
Right) –   Outcome when the estimated time when the
robot sees the participant intersects with the timestamp
of  the  RGB-D  image  recording.As  a  result,   the
algorithm outputs that image as a private data belonging
to the person identified in the image.
If  more  that  one  person  is  identified  during  HRI,
meaning that some RFID intervals overlap,  then more
than  one  participant  is  in  the  image.   In  such  a  case,
the  picture  is  the  private  data  belonging  to  all  these
persons, and anonymization algorithms can be applied
so  that  individuals  cannot  recognize  other  people  in
the  image.   Further,  a  person  can  request  the  deletion
of  the  link  between  him  and  the  image.Given  the
sufficient anonymity level, if the individual is no longer
recognizable  on  the  image,  that  image  is  no  longer
considered  that  participant’s  private  data.Once  the
last participant requests deletion, then the image can be
deleted.
3.4.    Identity Management with Smart
Contracts and UID
Identity management comprises two phases  –  proof
of ownership of the UID (retrieved from RFID tag) and
proof of identity by a digital signature. Once proven the
identity, a user may access all the images with his/her
associated UID. We illustrate theRegistrationand the
Authenticationon Fig. 5.
Registration:to interact with a private permissioned
BC user must belong to the network. In our architecture,
the proof of membership to the BC is managed by the
smart contracts. As a first step, a user should provide his
UID and a public key through a user interface and issue
a new transaction to the BC with his UID (hashed) and
public key as a payload. Further, once the transaction is
initiated, the smart contract will require the user to sign
the transaction with his/her private key. Once signed, the
smart contract performs a public key recovery to prove
that  the  digital  signature  belongs  to  the  user’s  public
key.   Given the cryptographic relation between private
and  public  keys,  and  a  digital  signature  inferred  from
the private key, it is possible to recover a public key from
the digitally signed transaction.  Once the public key is
confirmed to belong to the user,  and the transaction is
valid, the UID with the user’s public key will be installed
on the Blockchain, and the user can begin the process of
authentication for future access the data under that same
UID.
Authentication:To  access  private  data,  the  user
needs  to  authenticate  to  the  network  by  providing  his
previously registered UID. Once provided,  the UID is
hashed, and the smart contract search for the UID on the
BC. If any hash of UID installed on BC matches the UID
that an individual claims to own, then the smart contract
performs  a  public  key  recovery  algorithm  (explained
above) to recover a public key from the digitally signed
transaction. Once the public key matches the public key
installed on the BC under the provided UID, the user is
the UID owner.  Therefore, the proof of UID ownership
is successful, and the user can access his private data.
4.    Implementation and case study
As  a  proof  of  concept,  we  established  an  initial
implementation of a BC-baseddAppbased on the design
guidelines  presented  in  section  3,  integrated  with  a
social  robot  (Fig.  6)  moving  in  hospital  corridors  and
rooms. Previous experience pointed out that the robotic
events  happen  on  the  high  frequency  with  potentially
thousands  of  images  per  minute.EOS  Blockchain
seemed to be an ideal solution to guarantee the quality
of  the  data  and  avoid  performance  bottlenecks  due  to
its  Delegated  Proof  of  Stake  (DPoS)  consensus  that
supports high transaction speed [24]. As far as we know,
we  are  the  first  to  integrate  EOS  Blockchain  to  audit
robotic events.
The   following   experiences   intend   to   test   the
architecture and to answer the question:”Is it possible

for  individuals  to  access  their  private  data  generated
during  their  interactions  with  the  robot  without  any
security breach for other participants?”In other words,
we want to know whether users can controlonlytheir
data,  and  personal  data  is  correctly  outlined.   For  the
sake of our research, participants should wear wireless
RFID  tags  embedded  in  smart  cards  to  be  correctly
recognized by a social robot with an RFID reader.  As
an  experimental  protocol,  we  consider  the  following
three  stages.Pre-experiment:(i)configuration  of
the  two  users  smart  cards  identified  by  RFID  tags,
(ii)preparation  of  one  social  robot  with  its  dedicated
camera for image recording and RFID sensor used for
detecting  and  positioning  of  RFID  tags,(iii)reset  of
the Blockchain and database, and create 1 (or 2) wallet
key pair(s) (one for each user),(iv)register each user in
the network with his/her RFID and key pair,(v)deploy
the BlockRobot API and a Mongo database (off-chain
repository).   Experiment execution:(i)the individuals
and the robot act as peers and are connected to the local
network,(ii)users  walk  near  the  robot,  and  the  robot
detects a person in less than 5 seconds (in the range of 3
meters). Post-experiment:(i)extraction of data logs and
process mining techniques are performed to evaluate the
system’s performance.
4.1.    Experiments
We   performed   many   different   experiments   and
summarised them in the four main scenarios.(i)One
person  walking  by  the  robot  carrying  the  RFID  card.
The robot is recording streams of RGB-D images and
detects  an  RFID  tag.   At  the  end  of  the  scenario,  the
person can access his/her data and visualize the images
recorded by the robot.(ii)The same scenario as before,
with one person and one robot recording RGB-D images
and detecting the person with its RFID laser.  However,
in this scenario,  the data is corrupted.  An example of
Figure 6:  MOnarCH Robot  –  the social robot used in
the experiments
Figure 7: Graph showing the execution of system events
during experiment 1.
corrupted data may result from a malicious party gaining
access  to  the  off-chain  repository  and  modifying  the
recorded  data.   This  configuration  shows  theIntegrity
property of the personal data assured by the proposed
framework because of the use of Blockchain as a trust
anchor. If some data is corrupted, then the integrity test
will fail.  Still, the user can access his/her personal data
and  have  the  information  that  the  data  was  corrupted.
The sensors’ corruption that could occur in the external
environment is out of this project’s scope.(iii)A third
scenario manifest slightly different configuration. Here,
two users walk by the robot,  one at the time,  without
intersecting their images. This experiment demonstrates
the feasibility of the BlockRobot algorithms to outline
the  private  data  to  the  participants  correctly.As  a
result of the experiment,  two individuals could access
their private data without causing any security breach to
the  other  participant.(iv)In  the  last  experiment,  two
individuals walk by the robot at the same time.  In the
real-world scenario,  this is possibly the most common
situation  because  it  is  common  to  have  many  people
walking  in  the  hospital  corridors  simultaneously.    In
this  scenario,  both  individuals  were  identified  by  the
robot, and their RFID intervals intersected, meaning that
two participants are identified in the same image.  Both
can  access  the  images  because  it  is  their  private  data.
However, the other’s individuals shapes are blurred as an
attempt to anonymize them in the image. In such a case,
the  participants’  confidentiality  is  guaranteed  because
it is not possible to detect them;  hence their identities
are covered by applying the anonymization techniques,

e.g., blurring faces.  Therefore the user can access data
or revoke access (delete data) without breaching of data
privacy of other users as no information is given about
other data subjects’ identities in the recording.

process mining techniques  [12]. from the data resulting
from  two  experiments:(i)one  person  and  one  robot

5.    Discussion and Limitations
This   section   discusses   the   proposed   solution,
including  the  privacy  validation  in  HRI,  the  GDPR
compliance, and the Blockchain benefits evaluation and
possible security and privacy threats.
5.1.    Privacy Validation in HRI
According   toArt.   4of   the   GDPR,”personal
data  means  any  information  relating  to  an  identified
or   identifiable   natural   person   (data   subject);    an
identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,
directly  or  indirectly,  in  particular  by  reference  to  an
identifier  such  as  a  name,  an  identification  number,
location  data,  an  online  identifier  or  to  one  or  more
factors [...].”, even when data are encrypted or hashed,
it qualifies as personal data under EU law [11].
We analyzed the GDPR legal documents [10,11] and
identified  the  main  privacy  conditions.    We  illustrate
in  Figure  9  the  mapping  between  the  GDPR  privacy
requirements and the BlockRobot design choices. From
the  related  work,  it  seems  clear  that  currently,  SRs
support  basic  privacy  requirements  such  asprinciple
of  purpose  limitation,data  minimization.   The  data
that the robot collect has the sole purpose of providing
suitable   interactions.Moreover,   the   robot   knows
the  minimum  amount  of  information,  inferred  from
its  embedded  sensors,  for  the  HRI.  Another  GDPR
privacy rule is theStorage Limitation–   enforced by
destroying the data that is no longer necessary [25].
In  Social  Robotics,   from  both  legal  and  ethical
perspectives,    we   foresee   that   users   should   have
information   transparency   and   fairness.Fairness
is   defined   by   M.   Fink   in   GDPR   [10,   p.   64]   as
clarity  regarding  the  purpose  of  data,  meaning  that
individuals  understand  the  purpose  of  data  collection.
Regarding  transparency  in  privacy,  theaccountability
andprovenanceof data is required.  Individuals should
be notified of all data processing activities in the past and
the future.  The provenance means the non-repudiation
of  the  data   –   the  source  of  the  data  should  be  clear
and unquestionable. In the context of social robots, this

tree/master/experiments
5
https://github.com/vvasylkovskyi/eos-web/
tree/master/documentation
means that individuals should be assured in some way
that  the  data  they  have  access  to  is  the  data  resulting
from their interaction with that robot.
Results    of    the    experiments    in    the    previous
section   validate   that   individuals   are   givenprivacy
by opacity–  no individual can access the data that does
not belong to him.  Moreover, the off-chain private data
is encrypted,  thus providing theconfidentialityof the
data.Besides,  off-chain  storage  enables  individuals
with the possibility toerase the data or revoke access.
Furthermore,   by  using  BC  as  a  trust  anchor,   it  is
possible to audit the history of data processing activities
in  retrospective  and  grant  the  participants  with  data
accountability,  and  the  possibility  toverify  the  data
integrityby  hashing  data.   Finally,  if  robots  interact
in  the  BC  as  peers  and  issue  transactions,  the  data’s
provenanceis guaranteed by design.
5.2.    Security and Privacy Threats
Identity  management  based  on  RFID  and  BC  is
an   innovative   approach.In   BlockRobot,   identity
management is based on placing the RFID tags on the
BC,  which  any  network  member  can  visualize.   One
of the privacy-sensitive topics to discuss is the degree
to  which  the  placing  of  RFID  tags  on  the  Blockchain
is  secure.    If  the  owner  of  the  RFID  tag  happens  to
be  discovered,  then  everybody  in  the  network  knows
who the individual that has been ”seen” by the robot is.
However, it is worth noting that they will not access the
individuals’ images even in his/her identity disclosure.
For  that  reason,  it  is  crucial  to  anonymize  the  RFID
tags  before  placing  them  in  BC.  In  the  definition  of
the GDPR [10],  the anonymity is the degree to which
it  is  impossible  to  re-identify  a  data  subject  from  the
data. We attempt to anonymize that data by hashing the
UIDs  extracted  from  the  tags;  however,  a  sufficiently
motivated  malicious  entity  may  re-identify  the  hash’s
Figure 9: Privacy Validation – GDPR Requirements and
BlockRobot Design Guidelines mapping

actual  UID.  The  platform  might  be  prone  to  pattern
analysis despite the use of hashed UIDs.  Whether the
storage of hashed RFID tags on Blockchain provides the
irreversibility in identification is the specific question to
each system/business involved, in our case, HRI.
In theory, the same problem may apply to the storage
of the hashes of depth images on BC. However, in the
case of depth images, it seems highly unlikely that some
intruder  may  reconstruct  the  depth  image  by  knowing
only the hash.  Therefore, we assume that the hashes of
depth images on BC are a secure option.
Another relevant topic for discussion is the security
of using the BlockRobot API as a trusted intermediary.
BlockRobot API access to the robotic events transferred
through the network is subject to aMan-in-the-middle
attack.  Such danger can be mitigated by delegating the
BlockRobot  API’s  computations  to  the  robot  wherein
the smart contracts execute all the data transformations
when  social  robots  issue  transactions.Hence,   due
to  the  simplification  of  the  experimental  environment,
BlockRobot   API   is   used   as   an   intermediary   to
demonstrate the concept’s feasibility.
5.3.    GDPR and the Right to be Forgotten
GDPR,  in  its  literature  [11],  explicitly  states  the
obligation of any entity with access to individuals data
to provide them with the”Right to be Forgotten”–  the
ability  to  erase  the  data.In  this  sense,  as  one  of
the leading design guidelines, we state that the private
data  should  not  be  stored  on  the  Blockchain  due  to
its  immutability,  which  invalidates  the  data’s  erasure.
As  a  solution,  the  privacy-by-design  applications  for
HRI  should  have  off-chain  storage  where  the  data
can  be  erased  [26].    Still,  an  open  question  remains
whether the corresponding hash of private data, which
remains on the BC forever,  is considered private data,
subject to particular environments and implementations,
and   related   to   the   hashes’   degree   of   anonymity
(the  sufficiently  anonymous  data  is  no  longer  private
data  [10]).   In  the  experience  performed  in  section  4,
it seems highly unlikely that some malicious entity may
re-identify the owner of an arbitrary RGB-D image by
knowing only the hash stored on BC. Therefore, hashes
of binary files, such as RGB-D images, when stored on
BC, at first glance,  may seem unlinkable to any outer
information.
Additionally,    a   loose   term   oferasureleaves
discussion  and  flexibility  as  to  when  some  data  shall
be  considered  deleted.    A  possible  solution  could  be
to destroy the private keys in the BC environment that
enable access to that data. Hence, by being inaccessible
or unreadable, in some interpretations, that private data
may be considered erased.
5.4.    EOS Blockchain Evaluation
Robotic  events  happen  at  a  very  high  frequency
with  potentially  thousands  of  events  per  minute.   The
experience  with  BC  applications  pointed  out  to  use
EOS Blockchain [24] because of its promising results
regarding  the  transaction  throughput  and  potential  of
scalability.Further,  the  results  of  our  performance
evaluation  indicate  that  there  is  a  place  to  improve
performance.
Moreover,  the  current  state  of  the  art  shows  other
implementations that attempt to integrate robotic events
with  the  BC.Iin  the  literature,  the  use  ofTezos[18,
20]   orAitheon[27]   BC   was   found.Besides,   a
new  research  area  is  emerging–the  Blockchain
interoperability [28] –  the ability to connect two or more
BC cooperating.  Given the benefits of BC, we foresee
the integration of many Blockchains with robots in the
future.   Therefore,  the  BlockRobot  could  enhance  the
privacy in HRI and cooperate with some other BC that
offers some other solutions.
6.    Conclusions and Future work
SR   bears   potential   in   personal   assistant   robots,
healthcare,manufacturingindustry,education
assistants,    defense   agents,    public   space   hosting,
and  many  more.   In  particular,  people  tend  to  engage
with robots that look more like humans on an emotional
level.    Individuals  have  limited  knowledge  about  the
robots’  inference  abilities  and  what  information  they
may  happen  to  know  during  their  HRI.  We  need  to
provide them with adequate privacy-by-design features
to  comply  with  GDPR  requirements,  both  legally  and
ethically.BlockRobot  aims  at  being  a  step  in  the
right   direction   while   stimulating   the   discussion   on
privacy-by-design in SR.
As  future  work,  performing  demonstrations  with
real  stakeholders  to  evaluate  the  perceivedfairness
andtransparencyby   individuals   during   HRI   is   a
natural   step.Moreover,    the   images   are   being
presented  in  the  RAW  format,   and  using  a  stream
processing   could   increase   the   user   experience   and
the  quality  of  visualization  of  the  pictures.    Another
task  would  deem  to  remove  the  trusted  API  for  data
transformations  and  delegate  the  responsibility  to  the
robots,  wherein  the  business  logic  is  written  by  smart
contracts   and   robots   perform   transactions   on   their
own. Additionally, performing the evaluations regarding
the  hashes’  anonymity  stored  on-chain,  as  these  have
special  attention  under  GDPR  scope  [10,  p.  31].   The
anonymity improvements can be analyzed if using salted

of  peppered  hash  [10,  p.  31],  wherein  the  risks  can
be measured by pattern analyzes or collision resistance
attack.  Moreover, other sensors may be more invasive
to users’ privacy, e.g., audio and emotional state. Future
studies on the inclusion of these privacy-sensitive data
shall  be  considered.We  believe  that  the  matter  of
privacy in HRI is a complex issue and needs much work
to be done and that our research will serve as a ground
point to further investigation.
